								<strong>Professionally: </strong>
								<br>
								<p>As a hairstylist, turned political scientist, turned web developer, I bring a unique interdisciplinary approach to web development. I like working in teams. I won't pretend I know something if I don't--I have a strict "don't fake it until you make it" policy because it creates more problems later on than you solve in
									
								the moment. I love the feeling of figuring out how to fix something I didn't know how to fix before. Given enough time (and internet access) I can figure out almost anything--that also includes repairing a broken dishwasher, a buggy gas furnace, and a broken down scooter.I'd rather ask questions first if I don't know
							
								something and research for the answer or best practice rather than take sloppy shortcuts. I am willing to change my mind about almost anything if convinced. I love efficiency as much as I love thoroughness--if you have a better way I want to know it. I like connecting seemingly unrelated things to get unexpected results. I like big ideas.
								</p>
								<br>
								<strong>Personally: </strong>
								<br>
								<p>I am a bipedal Homo Sapien in the Milky Way. I tend to take non-linear and unconventional paths. I have chronic curiousity that feels like an emotional itch I must scratch. I enjoy writing non-fiction. I love books AND tv equally as much. I do not belong to a rock climbing gym. I think stand up comedians are legitimite philosophers with the bonus of providing the best antidote for the condundrum of the human condition. I don't think I am interested in being an immortal post-human, but I'm still open to more information about the possibility of uploading my brain when I die--so mark me down for "Currently Undecided".

				<p>Cutting hair involves precise attention to every detail in the structure of the design. It requires being able to take a 2-dimensional pattern, like a picture, and create a 3-dimensional sculpture. This transfer of observation into 3-dimensional object seems like an intuitive skill but it requires precise spatial reasoning and the ability to visualize and examine 3-Dimensions in your imagination before creating them externally. It also requires breaking down a complex end result into a step by step process not unlike the creation of an application: create the skeletal structure of your shape—the HTML, then customize the base shape so it looks how you want—the CSS, then refine the way the sculpture will lay and move according to the desired outcome—the JavaScript. </p>
				<p>As a political scientist we seek to measure or dissect things that often seem immeasurable through qualitative and quantitative indicators. For example, a question a political scientist might ask is if modern day liberal democracies create happier citizens than non-democratic systems of government. This requires analysis first of what exactly defines a liberal democracy and do any current systems fit these core prerequisites. If so, what are the defining principles of a liberal democracy. If not, then what might go into developing a quantitive definition of a liberal democracy? Open and free elections? An unrestricted and free press? Access to healthcare? Literacy rates of citizens as an indicator of access to education? So do we mark that down as literacy or access to education? Next you would ask how do we measure “happiness”? Is the root of gross national happiness economic in nature? Do we say the more economically successful a nation is the happier it’s citizens will be? But what about those who are wealthy but still miserable? What factors might cause unhappiness outside of economic stability? But let’s run a test real quick. If we flip that can we say that poverty contributes to unhappiness and thus that the lack of poverty would support the notion of an economic relationship to happiness? But wait, how do we define unhappiness other than the opposite of happiness? Is happiness the absence of suffering and unhappiness the presence of suffering? So wait, what defines suffering…This type of critical dissection is the structure of how public policy is eventually created through laws and reforms that will best produce the desire outcome. THIS process of discovery and dissection is also precisely how you turn an idea for a app into an actual app. What are our models? What fields need to be included in our model? What are the relationships of the models to each other and where will they intersect? The basis of all political theory is just philosophy, which demands the ability to use logical reasoning to dissect what and why something is the way it is. It requires proceeding forward in theories with known parameters of measurement while always testing what is known against new information to find any flaws or faults in your theory. It requires the discipline to constantly reexamine what seems obvious and consider factors that may seem unrelated. In development this translates into identifying structural relationships between data and being able to walk through step by step how.</p>
